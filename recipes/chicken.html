    <p>Gorgeous sticky, garlicky chicken kebabs perfect for the barbeque!</p>
    <p>This is truly my kind of summer. Tender, juicy, lemony-garlicky chicken bites threaded on a skewer with some charred red onions and lemon halves for even more extra lemon goodness.</p>
    <p>And believe me, I’ll still be throwing these on a cast iron grill pan on the stovetop during the winter months when it’s snowing out!</p>
    <p>NOTES:
        As always, chicken breasts can be used instead, and if rosemary is not your jam, you can substitute thyme (dried or fresh!) or any other herb of your choosing.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest

        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced
        </li>
        <li>1 shallot, minced
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
        </li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch chunks
        </li>
        <li>1 red onion, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
        </li>
