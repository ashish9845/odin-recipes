    <p><em>The quickest (easiest) sheet pan dinner! Serve with warm tortillas for a lightening fast weeknight meal. SO GOOD!</em></p>
    <p>A super speedy weeknight meal all made on one sheet pan? Yes, please!</p>
    <p>With a simple chili powder mixture using pantry ingredients (chili powder, cumin, oregano, and paprika), I have been making this at least once a week, swapping out the shrimp for my other favorite sheet pan dinner.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin

        </li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li><strong>CHILI POWDER MIXTURE:</strong> In a small bowl, combine chili powder, cumin, oregano, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
