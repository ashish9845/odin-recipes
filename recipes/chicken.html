    <p>Gorgeous sticky, garlicky chicken kebabs perfect for the barbeque!</p>
    <p>This is truly my kind of summer. Tender, juicy, lemony-garlicky chicken bites threaded on a skewer with some charred red onions and lemon halves for even more extra lemon goodness.</p>
    <p>And believe me, I’ll still be throwing these on a cast iron grill pan on the stovetop during the winter months when it’s snowing out!</p>
    <p>NOTES:
        As always, chicken breasts can be used instead, and if rosemary is not your jam, you can substitute thyme (dried or fresh!) or any other herb of your choosing.</p>
